/*
TailwindCSS helpers
This is used when classes arent placed in the markup but are used in arrays or functions

The format is as follows:
.tw-[class name] {
  @apply [tailwind class name];
}

Example:
You have a title that needs .text-2xl and .text-center
You would add the following to this file
.tw-text-2xl {
  @apply text-2xl;
}
.tw-text-center {
  @apply text-center;
}
